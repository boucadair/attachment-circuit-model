            A Common YANG Data Model for Attachment Circuits
                draft-ietf-opsawg-teas-common-ac-latest

Abstract

   The document specifies a common Attachment Circuits (ACs) YANG
   module, which is designed with the intent to be reusable by other
   models.  For example, this common model can be reused by service
   models to expose ACs as a service, service models that require
   binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device models to
   provision ACs, etc.

1.  Introduction

   Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via
   dedicated terminating points (e.g., Service Functions (SFs), Customer
   Premises Equipment (CPEs), Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs),
   data centers gateways, or Internet Exchange Points).  A connectivity
   service is basically about ensuring data transfer received from (or
   destined to) a given terminating point to (or from) other terminating
   points that belong to the same customer/service, an interconnection
   node, or an ancillary node.  A set of objectives for the connectivity
   service may eventually be negotiated and agreed upon between a
   customer and a network provider.  For that data transfer to take
   place within the provider network, it is assumed that adequate setup
   is provisioned over the links that connect customer terminating
   points and a provider network (a Provider Edge (PE), typically) so
   that data can be successfully exchanged over these links.  The
   required setup is referred to in this document as Attachment Circuits
   (ACs), while the underlying link is referred to as "bearer".

   This document adheres to the definition of an attachment circuit as
   provided in Section 1.2 of [RFC4364], especially:

      Routers can be attached to each other, or to end systems, in a
      variety of different ways: PPP connections, ATM Virtual Circuits
      (VCs), Frame Relay VCs, ethernet interfaces, Virtual Local Area
      Networks (VLANs) on ethernet interfaces, GRE tunnels, Layer 2
      Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnels, IPsec tunnels, etc.  We will
      use the term "attachment circuit" to refer generally to some such
      means of attaching to a router.  An attachment circuit may be the
      sort of connection that is usually thought of as a "data link", or
      it may be a tunnel of some sort; what matters is that it be
      possible for two devices to be network layer peers over the
      attachment circuit.

   When a customer requests a new value-added service, the service can
   be bound to existing attachment circuits or trigger the instantiation
   of new attachment circuits.  Whether these attachment circuits are
   specific for a given service or are shared to deliver a variety of
   services is deployment-specific.

   An example of attachment circuits is depicted in Figure 1.  A
   Customer Edge (CE) may be a physical node or a logical entity.  A CE
   is seen by the network as a peer Service Attachment Point (SAP)
   [RFC9408].  CEs may be dedicated to one single service (e.g., Layer 3
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Layer 2 VPN) or host multiple
   services (e.g., Service Functions [RFC7665]).  A single AC (as seen
   by a network provider) may be bound to one or multiple peer SAPs
   (e.g., "CE1" and "CE2").  For example, and as discussed in [RFC4364],
   multiple CEs can be attached to a PE over the same attachment
   circuit.  This is typically implemented if the Layer 2 infrastructure
   between the CE and the network provides a multipoint service.  The
   same CE may terminate multiple ACs.  These ACs may be over the same
   or distinct bearers.

                         Figure 1: Examples of ACs

   This document specifies a common module ("ietf-ac-common") for
   attachment circuits (Section 5).  The model is designed with the
   intent to be reusable by other models and, therefore, ensure
   consistent AC structures among modules that manipulate ACs.  For
   example, the common model can be reused by service models to expose
   AC-as-a-Service (ACaaS) (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]), service models that
   require binding a service to a set of ACs (e.g., Network Slice
   Service [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang])), network models
   to provision ACs (e.g., [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]),
   device models, etc.

   The common AC module eases data inheritance between modules (e.g.,
   from service to network models as per [RFC8969]).

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

1.1.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   Note to the RFC Editor: This section is to be removed prior to
   publication.

   This document contains placeholder values that need to be replaced
   with finalized values at the time of publication.  This note
   summarizes all of the substitutions that are needed.

   Please apply the following replacements:

   *  XXXX --> the assigned RFC number for this I-D

   *  2023-11-13 --> the actual date of the publication of this document

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   LxSM refers to both the Layer 2 Service Model (L2SM) [RFC8466] and
   the Layer 3 Service Model (L3SM) [RFC8299].

   LxNM refers to both the Layer 2 Network Model (L2NM) [RFC9291] and
   the Layer 3 Network Model (L3NM) [RFC9182].

   This document uses the following term:

   Bearer:  A physical or logical link that connects a customer node (or
      site) to a provider network.

      A bearer can be a wireless or wired link.  One or multiple
      technologies can be used to build a bearer.  The bearer type can
      be specified by a customer.

      The operator allocates a unique bearer reference to identify a
      bearer within its network (e.g., customer line identifier).  Such
      a reference can be retrieved by a customer and then used in
      subsequent service placement requests to unambiguously identify
      where a service is to be bound.

      The concept of bearer can be generalized to refer to the required
      underlying connection for the provisioning of an attachment
      circuit.

      One or multiple attachment circuits may be hosted over the same
      bearer (e.g., multiple Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) on the
      same bearer that is provided by a physical link).

   The names of data nodes are prefixed using the prefix associated with
   the corresponding imported YANG module as shown in Table 1:

        +============+==================+========================+
        | Prefix     | Module           | Reference              |

                          Figure 2: AC Data Models

   "ietf-ac-common" is imported by "ietf-bearer-svc", "ietf-ac-svc", and
   "ietf-ac-ntw".  Bearers managed using "ietf-bearer-svc" may be
   referenced in the service ACs managed using "ietf-ac-svc".
   Similarly, a bearer managed using "ietf-bearer-svc" may list the set
   of ACs that use that bearer.  In order to ease correlation between an
   AC service requests and the actual AC provisioned in the network,
   "ietf-ac-ntw" uses the AC references exposed by "ietf-ac-svc".  To
   bind Layer 2 VPN or Layer 3 VPN services with ACs, "ietf-ac-glue"
   augments the LxSM and LxNM with AC service references exposed by
   "ietf-ac-svc" and AC network references exposed by "ietf-ac-ntw".

4.  Description of the AC Common YANG Module

   The full tree diagram of the module is provided in Appendix A.
   Subtrees are provided in the following subsections for the reader's
   convenience.

4.1.  Features

   The module defines the following features:

   'layer2-ac':  Used to indicate support of ACs with Layer 2
      properties.

   'layer3-ac':  Used to indicate support of ACs with Layer 3
      properties.

   'server-assigned-reference':  Used to indicate support of server-
      generated references to access relevant resources.

      For example, a bearer request is first created using a name which
      is assigned by the client, but if this feature is supported, the
      request will also include a server-generated reference.  That
      reference can be used when requesting the creating of an AC over
      the existing bearer.

4.2.  Identities

   The module defines a set of identities, including the following:

   'address-allocation-type':  Used to specify the IP address allocation
      type in an AC.  For example, this identity can used to indicate
      whether the provider network provides DHCP service, DHCP relay, or
      static addressing.  Note that for the IPv6 case, Stateless Address
      Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] can be used.

   'local-defined-next-hop':  Used to specify next hop actions.  For
      example, this identity can be used to indicate an action to
      discard traffic for a given destination or treat traffic towards
      addresses within the specified next-hop prefix as though they are
      connected to a local link.

   'l2-tunnel-type':  Uses to control the Layer 2 tunnel selection for
      an AC.  The current version supports indicating pseudowire,
      Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), and Virtual eXtensible Local
      Area Network (VXLAN).

   'precedence-type':  Used to indicate the redundancy type when
      requesting ACs.  For example, this identity can be used to tag
      primary and secondary ACs.

   'role':  Used to indicate the type of an AC: User-to-Network
      Interface (UNI), Network-to-Network Interface (NNI), or public
      NNI.

   New administrative status types:  In addition to the status types
      already defined in [RFC9181], this document defines:

      *  'awaiting-validation' to report that a request is pending an
         adiministrator approval.

      *  'awaiting-processing' to report that a request was approved and
         validated, but is awaiting more processing before activation.

      *  'admin-prohibited' to report that a request cannot be handled
         because of administrative policies.

      *  'rejected' to report that a request was rejected reasons not
         covered by the other status types.

4.3.  Reusable Groupings

   The module also defines a set of reusable groupings, including the
   following:

   'op-instructions' (Figure 3):  Defines a set of parameters to specify
      scheduling instructions and report related events for a service
      request (e.g., AC or bearer).

     grouping service-status:
       +-- status
          +-- admin-status
          |  +-- status?        identityref
          |  +--ro last-change?   yang:date-and-time
          +--ro oper-status
             +--ro status?        identityref
             +--ro last-change?   yang:date-and-time
     grouping op-instructions:
       +-- requested-start?   yang:date-and-time
       +-- requested-stop?    yang:date-and-time
       +--ro actual-start?      yang:date-and-time
       +--ro actual-stop?       yang:date-and-time

                Figure 3: Operational Instructions Grouping

   Layer 2 encapsulations (Figure 4):  Groupings for the following
      encapsulation schemes are supported: dot1Q, QinQ, and priority-
      tagged.

   Layer 2 tunnel services (Figure 4):  These groupings are used to
      define Layer 2 tunnel services that may be needed for the
      activation of an AC.  Examples of supported Layer 2 services are
      the pseudowire (Section 6.1 of [RFC8077]), VPLS, or VXLAN
      [RFC7348].

     grouping dot1q:
       +-- tag-type?   identityref

       +-- tag-type?   identityref
       +-- svlan-id?   uint16
       +-- cvlan-id?   uint16

       +-- peer-mode?         identityref
       +-- peer-ip-address*   inet:ip-address
     grouping l2-tunnel-service:
       +-- type?         identityref
       +-- pseudowire
       |  +-- vcid?      uint32

          +-- peer-mode?         identityref
          +-- peer-ip-address*   inet:ip-address

                   Figure 4: Layer 2 Connection Groupings

   Layer 3 address allocation (Figure 5):  Defines both IPv4 and IPv6
      groupings to specify IP address allocation over an AC.  Both
      dynamic and static address schemes are supported.

      For both IPv4 and IPv6, 'address-allocation-type' is used to
      indicate the IP address allocation mode to activate.  When
      'address-allocation-type' is set to 'provider-dhcp', DHCP
      assignments can be made locally or by an external DHCP server.
      Such behavior is controlled by setting 'dhcp-service-type'.

      Note that if 'address-allocation-type' is set to 'slaac', the
      Prefix Information option of Router Advertisements that will be
      issued for SLAAC purposes will carry the IPv6 prefix that is
      determined by 'local-address' and 'prefix-length'.

   IP connections (Figure 5)::  Defines IPv4 and IPv6 groupings for
      managing Layer 3 connectivity over an AC.  Both basic and more
      elaborated IP connection groupings are supported.

     grouping ipv4-allocation-type:
       +-- prefix-length?             uint8
       +-- address-allocation-type?   identityref
     grouping ipv6-allocation-type:
       +-- prefix-length?             uint8
       +-- address-allocation-type?   identityref

   Routing parameters & OAM (Figure 6):  In addition to static routing,
      the module supports the following routing protocols: BGP
      [RFC4271], OSPF [RFC4577] or [RFC6565], IS-IS
      [ISO10589][RFC1195][RFC5308], and RIP [RFC2453].  For all
      supported routing protocols, 'address-family' indicates whether
      IPv4, IPv6, or both address families are to be activated.  For
      example, this parameter is used to determine whether RIPv2
      [RFC2453], RIP Next Generation (RIPng), or both are to be enabled
      [RFC2080].  More details about supported routing groupings are
      provided hereafter:

      *  Authentication: These groupings include the required
         information to manage the authentication of OSPF, IS-IS, BGP,
         and RIP.  The groupings support local specification of
         authentication keys and the associated authentication algorithm
         to accomodate legacy implementations that do not support key
         chains [RFC8177].  Similar to [RFC9182], this version of the
         common AC model assumes that parameters specific to the TCP-AO
         are preconfigured as part of the key chain that is referenced
         in the model.  No assumption is made about how such a key chain
         is preconfigured.  However, the structure of the key chain
         should cover data nodes beyond those in [RFC8177], mainly
         SendID and RecvID (Section 3.1 of [RFC5925]).

      *  BGP peer groups: Includes a set of parameters to identify a BGP
         peer group.  Such a group can be defined by providing a local
         AS Number (ASN), a customer's ASN, and the address families to
         be activated for this group.  BGP peer groups can be identified
         by a name.

      *  Basic parameters: These groupings include the minimal set of
         routing configuration that is required for the activation of
         OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, and RIP.

      *  Static routing: Parameters to configure an entry of a list of
         IP static routing entries.

      The 'redundancy-group' grouping lists the groups to which an AC
      belongs [RFC9181].  For example, the 'group-id' is used to
      associate redundancy or protection constraints of ACs.

   Bandwidth parameters (Figure 7):  Bandwidth parameters can be
      represented using the Committed Information Rate (CIR), the Excess
      Information Rate (EIR), or the Peak Information Rate (PIR).

      These parameters can be provided per bandwidth type.  Type values
      are taken from [RFC9181], e.g.,:

      *  'bw-per-cos':  The bandwidth is per Class of Service (CoS).

      *  'bw-per-site':  The bandwidth is to all ACs that belong to the

6.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-ac-common" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
   QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module defines a set of identities, types, and groupings.
   These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG modules.  The
   module by itself does not expose any data nodes that are writable,
   data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As such, there are
   no additional security issues related to the YANG module that need to
   be considered.

   Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
   information (e.g., 'ipv6-lan-prefixes' or 'ipv4-lan-prefixes').
   Disclosing such information may be considered a violation of the
   customer-provider trust relationship.

   Several groupings ('bgp-authentication', 'ospf-authentication',
   'isis-authentication', and 'rip-authentication') rely upon [RFC8177]
   for authentication purposes.  As such, modules that will reuse these
   groupings will inherit the security considerations discussed in
   Section 5 of [RFC8177].  Also, these groupings support supplying
   explicit keys as strings in ASCII format.  The use of keys in
   hexadecimal string format would afford greater key entropy with the
   same number of key- string octets.  However, such a format is not
   included in this version of the common AC model, because it is not
   supported by the underlying device modules (e.g., [RFC8695]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ac-common
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry:

      Name:  ietf-ac-common
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ac-common
      Prefix:  ac-common
      Maintained by IANA?  N
      Reference:  RFC XXXX
