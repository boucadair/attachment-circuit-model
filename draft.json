This example demonstrates how the AC service model permits to manage connectivity requirements for complex Network Functions - containerized or virtualized -  that typically met in Telco Networks. The use of parent ACs to model the connectivity requirements of the Network Function in a flexible and scalable way. 

The Network Function have the following characteristics:
- The Network Function is distributed on a set of computes with scaled-out and redundant instances. 
- The NF has two distinct type of instances: user plane (nf-up) and  routing control plane (nf-cp).
- The User plane component can be distributed among the first 8 compute nodes (compute-1 to compute-08) to achieve high performance.
- The Control plane is deployed in a redundant fashion on 2 instances running on distinct compute nodes (compute-09 and compute-10).
- The NF is attached to distinct networks, each making use of a dedicated vlan. These vlans are therefore instantiated as separate Attachment Circuits. From a realization standpoint, the NF interface connectivity is generally provided thanks to macvlan or SR-IOV. For the sake of simplicity only 2 vlans are presented in this example, additional vlans are generally configured based on similar logic.

Firstly, Figure ??? describes the physical infrastructure on which attachment circuits are provisionned. The compute nodes (customer) are attached to the provider infrastructure thanks to a set of bearers (i.e. compute-XX-nicY). The provider infrastructure can be realized in multiple ways, such as  IP Fabric, Gateways or L2/L3 Edge Routers. This document does not intend to detail these aspects.



- A virtual IP address is assigned to the NF to provide a single point of access to the NF.
